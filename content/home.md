<span class="illuminated-letter">As</span> someone who makes a living at designing and developing web interfaces, I spend a lot of time evaluating whether a site or application is easy to understand, easy to navigate, and is accessible to all &mdash; regardless of their ability or background.

Often in this process, I turn to iconography or other graphical elements to give further context to the information, to group related topics, or to improve the overall aesthetics of a page.

This is common practice in modern web design, and as I see the ever-growing prevalence of iconography in web and mobile applications, I am often reminded of the ancient hieroglyphics of Egypt in the way that their means of communication is composed of symbolic and iconic references to the world around them.

This indeed, is an accurate observation. There are many similarities between these ancient communication methods and today. In fact, we may be able to gain clues to what our future communication may look like by examining the sign and symbol use of the past.

## Icon, Index, Symbol

Culturally, there are very large differences between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the global internet communities of today &mdash; but perhaps, if we examine the signs and symbols of yesterday and today through the lens of semiotics &mdash; we may gain some valuable insight into the similarities they both share. 

What though, is semiotics? 

Semiotics is the study of signs and how meaning is derived from a sign. Semiotics is closely aligned with linguistics, but focuses its study on the signs and symbols that form human communication.

A sign can be just about anything that can be perceived and interpreted into meaning. A sign does not need to be only visual, but can also be a sound, a smell or even a touch. In very simple terms, a sign is anything that stands for something else. However, there are different types of signs, and specific rules that govern how they work.

The two founders of semiotics were Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce, though both developed their theories independently.

Saussure stated that there were two parts to a sign: the signifier and the signified.
The signifier is the form of the sign, such as an image, a color, a sound or object.
The signified is the object or concept that is being represented, like a warning of danger, or a location to catch a bus.

Peirce’s theory was similar, but added a third component to the nature of a sign. He stated that a sign was composed of a representamen (signifier), an object (signified) and the interpretant. The interpretant is the interpretation that the audience makes between the two. For example, a skull and crossbones image (the signifier) on a bottle of poison (the signified), would mean to most people warning or danger (the interpretant).

</figure>

The interpretant is an important factor to a sign, for the meaning of a sign is not fixed. The meaning can change based on culture, social class, time, and situational context. Today, an image of a flag can indicate patriotism, can be used to mark information as important, or to mark something suspicious; in this case, the meaning for this same image changes according to the context in which it is used. 

The signifier can also change. The depiction of an actual object can be both highly realistic or quite simple and abstracted and have it still convey the same meaning depending on the context.

    <p class="article-img-text text-align-center">Both are understood as a lightbulb.</p>
</figure>

In addition to defining the anatomy of a sign, Peirce also classified the type of signs. Peirce says that the form a sign takes – or its signifier – can take one of three forms:

 <div class="flex margin-bottom-3 flex-items-center">
    <div style="width: 50px" class="margin-right flex-shrink-0"><img src="https://tankgirl-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/codepen-images/lightbulb.svg" alt="lightbulb" /></div>
    <div><p class="margin-0"><strong>Icon:</strong> Has a physical resemblance to the object it is representing.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="flex margin-bottom-3 flex-items-center">
    <div style="width: 50px" class="margin-right flex-shrink-0"><img src="https://tankgirl-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/codepen-images/skull-crossbones.svg" alt="skull and crossbones" /></div>
    <div><p class="margin-0"><strong>Index:</strong> Refers to or has relationship to the object or concept. An image of a cloud can indicate rain or a skull indicate death.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="flex margin-bottom-3 flex-items-center">
    <div style="width: 50px" class="margin-right flex-shrink-0"><img src="https://tankgirl-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/codepen-images/power-off.svg" alt="power off" /></div>
    <div><p class="margin-0"><strong>Symbol:</strong> The signifier is completely arbitrary and has to be culturally learned. For example, the commonly used power symbol on an electronic device.</p></div>
</div>


When we look around us, we see a combination of these signs everywhere. And as more and more of our lives become entwined with digital technology, sign usage will likely increase. We also see the same categories of signs, in the form of hieroglyphics, in ancient civilizations &mdash; notably ancient Egypt.

At its core, the prevalence of symbology and iconography is due to the evolution of communication driven by the increasing complexity of a civilization &mdash; including our own.

## Ancient Egypt

There is something about the pictorial nature about Egyptian hieroglyphics that seems to capture one’s interest and imagination. When one looks at the clean arrangement of signs, depicting birds and snakes, and people performing tasks from ancient Egyptian life, they feel both understandable and enigmatic. Indeed, until the Rosetta Stone was discovered in the nineteenth century, people had to largely guess at their meaning &mdash; often by inserting their own cultural biases.

The Rosetta Stone, a large stone tablet carved during that Hellenistic Period, features three groupings of the same text &mdash; a decree from Ptolemy V.  

<figure class="article-img left">

</figure>

The first grouping is in hieroglyphics, the second in demotic, and the third in ancient Greek. Using both the ancient Greek text and an understanding of the ancient Coptic language (a descendant of the ancient Egyptian language) that researchers were able to decipher both the hieroglyphics and demotic script.

It was revealed that the glyphs were more than just a series of pictograms, but were a combination of logograms, phonograms, and determinatives. 

A logogram also known as an ideogram is an icon that represents a word or idea, a phonogram is a symbol that represents a vocal sound, and a determinative is a symbol to give context and clarify the meaning of a word and usually follows phonograms. A single symbol could function as all three – its meaning depending on context. This does present some difficulty when trying to translate, as there is much nuance with symbol placement, orientation and arrangement.

It is unknown how this system of writing originated, as there are no known examples of any earlier form of hieroglyphics, but it is theorized that the Egyptians borrowed the concept of writing from the Sumerians and developed a system that worked for both their language and cultural ideas and practices.

If Egyptians did indeed adopt writing from the Sumerians, they would have recognized the inherent value of having their own form of writing. By the time that hieroglyphics are known to have appeared, Egyptian society was large and complex enough to require financial accounting, administrative record keeping, as well as having a ruling class that would want to use writing as a means for propaganda and immortality.

This writing system was initially the domain of the priestly class, who were responsible for not only the religious duties of Egyptian society, but also for state administration. The scribes of this priestly class developed a cursive version of the formal hieroglyphics, called hieratic, which was easier and quicker to write. Hieratic then evolved into demotic, a more simplified and abstracted script. All three writing forms coexisted, but their uses depended on what was being communicated. Hieratic and demotic were for more common purposes like general record keeping while the traditional hieroglyphics were for more formal purposes like royal tombs and monuments.

Hieroglyphics, demotic and hieratic script continued to be used throughout the Greek and Roman occupation of Egypt, but over time it was replaced by the more modern Greek writing and then eventually forgotten. Their influence on future cultures still remain, for they form the root of the Roman alphabet that we use today.

## The Digital Past and Present

<blockquote class="margin-bottom-6 background-gray-light-10 padding-3">Simple images can communicate with wide audiences over time. Icon design is like solving a puzzle, trying to marry an image and idea that, ideally, will be easy for people to understand and remember.<span>Susan Kare</span></blockquote>


Fast forward over 1500 years to today and we now have our own versions of hieroglyphics. They may not have the same mysterious allure as the Egyptian versions but we also have signs drawn from our own reality and cultural backgrounds.

When computers first moved away from text-based terminal screens and commands to graphical user interfaces (GUI), it was quickly discovered that they would need to design these interfaces to be easy to use across a broad population of users &mdash; many who would be encountering a computer for the first time. To do this, signs were created using images that would make sense to a user performing a task virtually that would mirror an action taken in real life. Thus, computer files were stored in folders or put in a trash to delete, so the images were drawn to look like office file folders and trash cans.

David Canfield Smith, a computer scientist and pioneer of the first GUI, the Xerox Star, was the first to create what we now give the general term of icon. In fact, he is the one credited with coining the term icon as he compared them to the religious icon which were pictures imbued with double meaning. This term does conflict a bit with Peirce’s scientific classification for signs, but it is now part of the popular lexicon for computer interface images.

After the Xerox Star, icon development continued and was improved by artist Susan Kare who was hired to create icons for the first MacIntosh operating system – the Apple Lisa. Many of the icons she created were virtually the same as those that were made for the Xerox Star, but their design was refined and many new icons were added, such as the clock, the disk and particularly, the bomb and happy Mac &mdash; for which Macs are still famous. Interestingly, the first image-based font, developed by Susan Kare for the Mac, was named Cairo, a direct reference to the influence of Egyptian hieroglyphics.

Over time, as color monitors became available, screen resolutions increased, and computer functions became more complex, the quality and quantity of icons also increased. It was the invention of the iPhone in 2007 though, that really brought icon use to the forefront. Though more simple mobile phones also used icons to perform actions, the entire interface of the iPhone is dependent on the tapping of icons.

    <p class="article-img-text text-align-center">The first iPhone</p>
</figure>

In recent years, the more realistic icons of the early iPhone, are being replaced by flatter, more simplistic and abstracted designs. A prime example being Google’s Material design.

Why are icons so prevalent in the digital space when their use is relatively limited elsewhere? Why use an icon when text is more explicit?

In the early days of computing, icons were used to simulate an action that an office worker would be familiar with in real life, like storing files inside of a folder. A graphical interface that could be clicked on with a mouse, was easier than remembering a variety of text commands that the old terminals required.

Today, there are many types of computer screens with different resolutions and many digital devices that vary in screen size. This presents a unique design challenge. While the height of any webpage is infinite, as well as the number of pages to a site, the design’s width is limited to the width of the device it is displayed on. The user’s attention is also a finite resource. Most analytical data and user studies reveal that user engagement drops off after the first half of the page - a term called scroll depth &mdash; and most users do not venture past the first few pages.

When icons are used effectively they have the ability to solve these challenges. Icons can be easily recognizable. When common icons are used, users instantly recognize them and understand the actions or information that they should contain. This can help with navigation and tasks. It is particularly powerful if the icons are placed in expected areas of a site or application, or are placed in <a href="https://graphicmint.com/design-reading-patterns/">typical user scanning patterns</a>.

Icons can also save space. An icon will take up less valuable real estate than text, especially mobile devices, and can be used to reveal hidden information. A good example is the menu icon that we are all now familiar with. And though an icon takes up less space than text, it is a much better touch target on mobile devices which can increase usability and accessibility.

Many icons are also universal. Images like a house or an envelope are recognizable all over the world, which can help with communicating to users regardless of the language they speak or their level of literacy. I have often observed small children, including my own son, easily navigate a mobile device, purely by tapping on icons, long before they were able to read.

Lastly, icons can provide additional context to text. Specialized icons, known as emojis or emotion icons, can be helpful in person to person text communication where tone of voice is missing. Emojis are generally used in social media applications, but they have been an effective tool for email marketing, where companies are trying to capture a user's attention.

There are drawbacks and pitfalls to icon usage. Like Egyptian hieroglyphics, a single icon could have multiple meanings or a variety of icons could have the same meaning. If used inappropriately, the icon could confuse users as to what they should do.

<figure class="article-img-center margin-y-6">

    <p class="article-img-text text-align-center" style="max-width: 550px; width:100%">Each icon can mean the same thing or have different meanings depending on context. Using the wrong one could confuse users.</p>
</figure>

There is also cultural variation in what icons are used for specific meanings. If one is creating a site or application for an international audience, knowing what certain icons mean for certain tasks is important. [<a href="">10</a>]

Additionally, icons could pose some accessibility issues. If an icon is used in place of text, or if the icon is not labelled in some way, it could prevent users with visual disabilities from accessing information, as screen reading devices do not recognize or read images.

Context, icon placement, and audience are key to effective communication - today as it was a couple of millennia ago.

## The Future

What will the future hold for icon usage and digital communication?

<figure class="article-img left">

</figure>

As technology continues to become more sophisticated with device processing and storage exponentially increasing, more dynamic visual elements will probably be used. We are already starting to see animated icons. Adding movement to an image may help to communicate an action or concept – though care will have to be taken to make sure that it is not visually distracting.

Icons may also be further simplified and abstracted for use on small devices like wearables or in areas of applications where space is at a premium. Some icons also may be replaced with other images that are more relevant – such replacing the floppy disk icon (something that newer generations have not encountered), with another image.

There is a possibility though, that with increasing sophistication of voice and image recognition technologies that the devices we use today may be replaced with ones that rely more on verbal commands and automatic responses to movement. This may render icons antiquated and obsolete like the images carved into the tombs of long dead kings.
