<span class="illuminated-letter">As</span> someone who makes a living at designing and developing web interfaces, I spend a lot of time evaluating whether a site or application is easy to understand, easy to navigate, and is accessible to all – regardless of their ability or background.

Often in this process, I turn to iconography or other graphical elements to give further context to the information, to group related topics, or to improve the overall aesthetics of a page.

This is common practice in modern web design, and as I see the ever-growing prevalence of iconography in web and mobile applications, I am often reminded of the ancient hieroglyphics of Egypt and Central America as well as some of the religious symbolism that was common in Medieval Europe.

This indeed, is an accurate observation. There are many similarities between these ancient communication methods and today. In fact, we may be able to gain clues to what our future communication may look like by examining the sign and symbol use of the past.

<h2>Icon, Index, Symbol</h2>

Culturally there are very large differences between the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Central America, and collectively those are all quite different from the global internet communities of today – but perhaps, if we examine the signs and symbols of yesterday and today through the lens of semiotics – we may gain some valuable insight into the similarities they all share.

What though, is semiotics?

Semiotics is the study of signs and how meaning is derived from a sign. Semiotics is closely aligned with linguistics, but focuses its study on the signs and symbols that form human communication.
